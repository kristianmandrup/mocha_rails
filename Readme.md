# MochaRails (Multiple)

This is a fork of the mocha_rails plugin with support for multiple suite files.

The setup is the same, just include any file with -suite.js into the test/javascripts or spec/javascripts folder.

Then access the localhost:3000/mocha url to see a list of all the test suites.
